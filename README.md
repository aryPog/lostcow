### "Maze generator" wanna'be. 
At the start, the game gives you 4 or 5 directions to follow (in the form of arrows).
There are about 10-11 diferent maps, that are randomly picked. Ex:
- map01 -> have all the four directions unlocked.
- map02 -> have just the top and bottom unlocked.
  
And so on. The goal is to follow the directions given at the start, but after 5-6 misses (wrong diretion - acumulative)
the arrows are shown to the player again. That's it.
